# Alpine, Apache and PHP7 on Docker

__This image is not intended to be run AS IS but is rather to be used for building akeneo pim docker images__

It provides a pre-configured Apache (2.4) + mod_php (PHP 7.0) + MySQL web server, based on a single Debian 8 (Jessie) based container.
Apache is configured to run with the `docker` user.
The environment comes with some PHP 7.0 extensions: `acpu`, `mcrypt`, `intl`, `mysql`, `curl`, `gd`, `imagick`, `mongo` Mongo server non included.

This image is not intended to be use directly as it stands: You'd rather extend it and create custom environments on top of it.
